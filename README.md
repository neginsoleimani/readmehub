<details><br clear="both"><summary>Why should I make it?</summary>It's an easy way to answer questions that your audience will likely have regarding how to install and use your project and also how to collaborate with you.</details>
<br clear="both">

<details><br clear="both"><summary>Who should make it?</summary>Anyone who is working on a programming project, especially if you want others to use it or contribute.</details>
<br clear="both">

<details><br clear="both"><summary>When should I make it?</summary>Definitely before you show a project to other people or make it public. You might want to get into the habit of making it the first file you create in a new project.</details>
<br clear="both">

<details><br clear="both"><summary>Where should I put it?</summary>In the top level directory of the project. This is where someone who is new to your project will start out.

<details><br clear="both"><summary>How should I make it?</summary><br clear="both">While READMEs can be written in any text file format, the most common one that is used nowadays is Markdown. It allows you to add some lightweight formatting.</details>

<details><br clear="both"><summary>What is Markdown?</summary><br clear="both"><img align="left" height="150" src="https://i.postimg.cc/NMxN17YF/Markdown-mark-svg.png"  />Markdown is a markup language just like HTML, allowing you to format your online content in plain text. While some prefer to use it in order to publish content with the .md or .markdown output, others prefer it purely for the writing experience it offers.<br>Users with a tech background tend to love the smooth writing experience it offers, as it allows both writing and formatting to flow in a similar way as the coding way. However, not everyone is used to or fond of this experience.<br>This is because learning Markdown from scratch is not easy, and this is especially true if you have never coded before. Not only do you have to learn formatting with syntax, but you also have to learn a whole new writing experience. This usually requires a big change in one's writing habits.</details>

This is a web application that has been built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and has been developed using React framework.<br>
This is part of our university student projects, and it can be said that it is one of our first group assignments. We know that the application is not perfect and many more things need to be added, but we hope to make it more complete in the future.</p>

<h1 align="center">Description</h1>

The web application is made of three main parts:
1. Document.
2. Create Readme for my Project.
3. Create Protfolio.

<h3>Document</h3>

It also shows the number of received stars in this section.
