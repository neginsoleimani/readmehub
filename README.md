<h2 align="left">What is the README?</h2>

###

<p align="left">A README is a text file that introduces and explains a project. It contains information that is commonly required to understand what the project is about.</p>

###

<h2 align="left">Why should I make it?</h2>

###

<p align="left">It's an easy way to answer questions that your audience will likely have regarding how to install and use your project and also how to collaborate with you.</p>

###

<h2 align="left">Who should make it?</h2>

###

<p align="left">Anyone who is working on a programming project, especially if you want others to use it or contribute.</p>

###

<h2 align="left">When should I make it?</h2>

###

<p align="left">Definitely before you show a project to other people or make it public. You might want to get into the habit of making it the first file you create in a new project.</p>

###

<h2 align="left">Where should I put it?</h2>

###

<p align="left">In the top level directory of the project. This is where someone who is new to your project will start out. Code hosting services such as GitHub, Bitbucket, and GitLab will also look for your README and display it along with the list of files and directories in your project.</p>

###

<h2 align="left">How should I make it?</h2>

###

<p align="left">While READMEs can be written in any text file format, the most common one that is used nowadays is Markdown. It allows you to add some lightweight formatting.</p>

###

<p align="left">Markdown is a markup language just like HTML, allowing you to format your online content in plain text. While some prefer to use it in order to publish content with the .md or .markdown output, others prefer it purely for the writing experience it offers.<br>Users with a tech background tend to love the smooth writing experience it offers, as it allows both writing and formatting to flow in a similar way as the coding way. However, not everyone is used to or fond of this experience.<br>This is because learning Markdown from scratch is not easy, and this is especially true if you have never coded before. Not only do you have to learn formatting with syntax, but you also have to learn a whole new writing experience. This usually requires a big change in one's writing habits.</p>
